# Python Object-Relational Mapping Project

## Overview

This project focuses on connecting Python scripts to a MySQL database using both MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy modules. It involves executing SQL queries, inserting rows into tables, and utilizing Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to abstract storage operations.

## General Concepts Covered

- Connecting to a MySQL database from a Python script
- Performing SELECT and INSERT operations on MySQL tables from a Python script
- Understanding ORM and its significance
- Mapping a Python Class to a MySQL table

## Requirements

- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Execution environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.8.5
- MySQLdb version 2.0.x
- SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
- Files ending with a new line
- Shebang `#!/usr/bin/python3` as the first line in all files
- Mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Code should adhere to PEP 8 style guide (pycodestyle version 2.7.*)
- Executable files
- File length tested using wc
- Documentation for all modules, classes, and functions
- Usage of SQLAlchemy without using execute
- Documentation should be meaningful sentences explaining the purpose of modules, classes, and functions
